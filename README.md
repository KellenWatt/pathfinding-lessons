# Pathfinding and Data Structures Introduction

**Hi there! This is branch of the repository with reference implementations for each of the exercise groups.
These are used to develop the tests and are meet the minimum functional expectations to pass them. 
Basically, these are the answers, and odds are good that you shouldn't be here. If you're totally stuck on
one, you can look at these to get a hint as to where to go, but you *really* shouldn't use these to
write your solutions.**
